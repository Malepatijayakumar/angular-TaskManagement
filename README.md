# angular-TaskManagement

As part of this project we just used all the core functionalities of angular by using some sample data. 

Functionality :- It manages the user tasks. Some users and tasks were created at the code level, whereas we can also add an tasks and complete the tasks for an user. To provide some smoothful experience we are using the localStorage which handles the data at the browser level.
